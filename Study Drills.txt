Exercise 4:

The error basically states that there was no assigned variable with the name "car_pool_capacity". The reason could be either that he forgot to put the variable there, or he made a typo somewhere. Either way, the program did not know what number to assign the variable as a result

1.
In this instance 4.0 and 4 would do the same, as it doesn't use the decimal in any way.

2.
In contrast to an iterger number, a floating point number can expand in components, creating a wider range as a result and be more specific

3. Done

4.
"=" assigns a value to the variables

5.
Duely noted

6. Done

Excersise 5:

1, 2, 4. Done

F 	Floating point decimal format. 	
g 	Same as "e" if exponent is greater than -4 or less than precision, "f" otherwise.
